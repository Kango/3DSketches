Welcome to Shape Editor ------------------------
The program allows you to draw and edit shapes in 3D, e.g. a space ship. 
The shape can then be exported as a processing sketch.

The entire shape consists of many shapes, like the walls, the ceiling and so on.

To achieve this, you start in a mode to draw points. Here, you enter points with the mouse.
These are the corners of the shapes. 
You can edit the points, remove them or move them (x, y and z direction).

In a second mode you can then connect the points with the mouse.
A typical shape has only 3 or 4 corners (wall or ceiling) but you can have as many corners as you like. 
To finish a shape, you hit return.
Then you can start entering the next shape. 

To export the shapes, you hit x. The entire new processing sketch is now in your direct window.
You can copy it from there and paste it in a new(!) processing sketch and run it.

You can always switch between the 2 modes. 
In both modes you see a help text on the right side of the screen which shows your options (yellow box). 
To quit the program hit Z (Shift-Z)
